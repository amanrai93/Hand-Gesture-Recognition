# Gesture recognition in Smart TVs
## Developed a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
- Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
- Stop: Pause the movie
 
Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).
